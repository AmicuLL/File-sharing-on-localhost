# WinShareLoc

WinShareLoc is a project aimed at simplifying file sharing between computers within the same local area network. While it's an ambitious challenge, the goal is to create a convenient solution for users facing file transfer inconveniences.

## Why WinShareLoc?

Ever found yourself searching for a USB drive or resorting to web platforms for file transfers between your laptop, PC, and gaming rig? WinShareLoc addresses this by enabling seamless file sharing within your local network. Utilize your gaming PC as a dedicated storage and backup accessible via Remote Desktop Connection. Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for USB drives and dealing with disappearing shared folders.

## API Reference

**Build and Download: [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/)** (Recommended to use MS Studio for the first attempt. Trust me!)

| Parameter    | Required | Description                  |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `wxWidgets`  | **YES**  | Graphic User Interface      |
| `MS Studio`  | `IDK, yes?` | (Possibly required, consider using another compiler)

Encountering issues with wxWidgets? I faced challenges with mingw, clang, and msys, leading me to code in VS2022. To be honest, a setup with Neovim and quality plugins is often superior to this heavyweight ship.

## Contributing

I lack experience in GUI and in-depth coding, so any suggestions are welcome. While the project may have started as a joke, who knows where it could lead...
